## Data Source

This project uses public-use microdata from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE),
published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Raw FMLI and MTBI files (quarterly extracts) were processed locally using PostgreSQL.
Due to data size and licensing considerations, the full raw datasets are not included
in this repository.

All data construction steps are fully documented in the SQL scripts provided in the
`sql/` directory.
